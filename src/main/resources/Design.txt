Used Spring Data JPA to expose CRUD services to manage the database.
Used the Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm to calculate the shortest path. This was exposed as a spring service for re-use.
The algorithm was injected in the Webservice endpoint and Home controller. Thymeleaf UI uses the controller to get the shortest path.
The algorith can also be called from the exposed soap web service.
The design approach I took was to implement a spring web mvc application using controllers, services and repository.
In this approach, you have separation of concerns, achieve loose coupling through dependency injection.
You achieve high cohesion in your classes as they tend to one specific task. This improves maintainability of the application.
